# Pharmacy-Management-System

A Pharmacy Management System in C++ with file handling is a software application designed to efficiently manage the operations of a pharmacy. It allows pharmacists and staff to handle tasks such as inventory management, prescription processing, patient records, and sales, while using file handling for data storage and retrieval. Here's a project description for building a Pharmacy Management System in C++:

Project Title: Pharmacy Management System in C++ with File Handling

Project Overview:
The Pharmacy Management System is a software solution that streamlines the daily operations of a pharmacy. This system provides an easy-to-use interface for pharmacy staff to manage inventory, process prescriptions, maintain patient records, and generate reports. The project is implemented in C++ and uses file handling for data storage.

Features:

Inventory Management:
Keep track of the pharmacy's inventory, including medicines, medical equipment, and supplies.
Automatically update inventory levels when items are sold or restocked.
Set alerts for low stock or expiring items.

Prescription Processing:
Enter and store prescription information, including patient details, prescribed medications, and dosage instructions.
Check for drug interactions and contraindications.
Generate labels for dispensed medications.

Sales and Invoicing:
Record sales transactions, including the date, items sold, and prices.
Generate itemized invoices for patients.
Calculate and manage taxes and discounts.

Search and Reporting:
Implement a search function for quick access to patient records, prescriptions, and inventory.
Generate reports on sales, inventory status, and prescription history.
Analyze sales trends and item popularity.

Data Security and Access Control:
Implement user authentication and roles to ensure data security and privacy.
Restrict access to sensitive patient and prescription information.

File Handling:
The system will use file handling to store and retrieve data, including inventory records, prescription data, patient information, and sales transactions. You can use text files, CSV files, or structured data files to securely store this information. Make sure to incorporate proper error handling and data validation to protect against data corruption and unauthorized access to files.

Technologies and Tools:
C++ for coding the application.
File handling in C++ for data storage.
An integrated development environment (IDE) like Code::Blocks or Visual Studio for development.
